Bugs: 
	- Alpha renaming somewhat buggy; can check for free and bounded variables but issue doing actual substitution
		- Code commented out because it crashes whole thing
		- Left in to show train of thought in dev process
	- Couldn't use parser.ozf, Oz couldn't find file on path; utilized alternative test file instead
	- Eta and Beta conversions fully functional!
	- 100% recursive, no iteration
